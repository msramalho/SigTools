### Exporting Calendar Events
SigTools exports to [iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) *.ics* format which means most applications handle it pretty well, namely

### Performance
It was developed to be as non-intrusive as possible, requires minimal permissions, only executes processes when it needs to, and all the scripts are loaded after the pages are ready so as to minimize any interface performance impact!


# Contribute to SigTools
You can contribute by:
 - Identifying and reporting [issues](https://github.com/msramalho/SigTools/issues)
 - Fixing bugs - fork + branch + pull request
 - Adding more [modules/extractors](https://github.com/msramalho/SigTools/tree/master/js/extractors) each module should address a different calendar need
 - Sharing this Extension



<details>
<summary>Contribution guide</summary>
<p>


## Developing with gulp.js and npm
1. fork project
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run chrome-watch` or `npm run firefox-watch` or `npm run opera-watch` during development
   1. the way to upload development extensions will vary depending on the browser see below
   2. point it to the correct folder that is maintained with live-reload inside the `build/` folder
4. run `npm run build` when ready for final tests followed by `npm run zip` to create all the zip files (this step is optional in PRs)
5. pull-request once ready (do not include `/build` or `/dist`)



##### Load the extension in Chrome & Opera
1. Open Chrome/Opera browser and navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Select "Developer Mode" and then click "Load unpacked extension..."
3. From the file browser, choose to `my-slack-workspaces/build/chrome` or (`my-slack-workspaces/build/opera`)


##### Load the extension in Firefox
1. Open Firefox browser and navigate to about:debugging
2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and from the file browser, choose `my-slack-workspaces/build/firefox/manifest.json`


### Packaging
Run `npm run build` + `npm run zip` to create a zipped, production-ready extension for each browser (atm there seems to be a [strange issue](https://github.com/msramalho/SigTools/issues/76) with `npm run dist`). 
 


## Code structure
 * `extractors` for all the scripts that extract information from a page and act accordingly
 * `lib` for external scripts
 * `scripts` for the JS scripts that are atomic or that are used for an `html` page
 * `utils` for functions that are reused among the `extractors` and other scripts

In the [manifest.json](manifest.json) file, in the `content_scripts` section, there is an initial match to load all the global scripts and then, for each page, each extractor is loaded.

### Extractors code
```javascript
class NewExtractor extends Extractor{
    constructor() {
        super();
        ...
        this.ready(); // this will trigger init and then attachIfPossible
    }
    //must implement: structure, attachIfPossible
    structure() { return {...} }
    attachIfPossible() {...}
    ...
}
// All the functions that are used by this script but do not
// belong to the class definition should follow the above line
...
```
By default, each extractor that inherits from `Extractor` already has the `storage.boolean.apply` and `storage.text.exclude_urls_csv` options.

The `structure()` method should return an object that describes the extractor, following this stub:
```javascript
{
    extractor: "the name of the extractor", // must be unique among extractors
    description: "a simple description of what it does",
    parameters: [{//a list of the parameters that can be used ny users
            name: "name of the parameter",
            description: "either describe or exemplify"
        }
        //... other parameters
    ],
    storage: { // the variables to save for this extractor (in the local storage)
        text: [ //variables that should be displayed and edited in <input type="text">
            {
                name: "the name of the variable, eg: title",
                default: "The default value, eg: [${acronym}] - ${room.name}"
            }
        ],
        textarea: [ //variables that should be displayed and edited in <textarea></textarea>
            {
                name: "description",
                default: "another description - can have <strong>HTML</strong> inside"
            }
        ],
        boolean: [ //variables that should be displayed and edited in <input type="checkbox">
            {
                name: "isHTML",
                default: true
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
After developing a new extractor, it should be added to the [options.html](options.html) page as `<script src="js/extractors/NAME.js"></script>` next to the ones already there.

<!-- same for tests and <script></script> -->

### Tests
Testing a browser extension is hard. Nonetheless, we try. Tests are located in the [test](test/) folder and we use [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) along with some [improvised magic](tests/setup.js).

To run tests open the [tests.html](tests.html) file on the browser (we advise [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VSCode), this was the only way as chrome extensions cannot be fully developed as ES6 modules, as of now. This system works fairly well.

To create a new test, check the previous ones. If you need to load html as the current jquery context (you will for every test with jquery selectors) you can do:
```javascript
describe('what the test is about', function() {
    it('should return some results', function(done) {
        updatejQueryContext("new_context.html").then(() => {
            // your tests
            done()
        }).catch(done)
    })
})
```
or, for the context to be global:

```javascript
describe('what the test is about', function() {
    before(() => {
        return new Promise((resolve)=>{
            updatejQueryContext("new_context.html").then(resolve)
        })
    })
    it('should return some results', function(done) {
        // your tests
    })
})
describe(...
```

After developing a new test, it should be added to the [options.html](options.html) page as `<script src="test/extractors/NAME.js"></script>` next to the ones already there.
